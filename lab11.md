I joined the #a11y channel on HexChat. It seemed really cool! :)

### Compare the HCI issues in individual interaction with group interaction.
-Not everyone speaks the same language (programming and spoken)
-Getting into new groups is difficult to find/ gain respect in communities

### Discuss several issues of social concern raised by collaborative software.
-There are malicious people who might not have helpful intents.
-Not everyone who wants to help has the skills to help

### Discuss the HCI issues in software that embodies human intention.
-AI and machine learning are not as advanced as human interaction.
-Eliza is a good example of this, where she can chat, but is obviously a computer.

### Why Coding Style Matters
In school, you will lose points if you have sloppy code. This teaches you to be a good coder, because in the real world you don't lose points but you could be fired. Or have terrible coding style, where nobody can understand anything you wrote.
Documenting your work and using a clean style makes everyone's life easier, including your own. And, it makes spotting mistakes easier.
Some coding styles include:
-How and when to use comments,
-Tabs or spaces for indentation (and how many spaces),
-Appropriate use of white space,
-Proper naming of variables and functions,
-Code grouping an organization,
-Patterns to be used,
-Patterns to be avoided
-Be kind to your future self

### Douglas Crockford
Your brain influences how you code. Your brain is two systems: the analytical system that does reasoning and logic, but it's slow and requires a lot of effort. System one is heuristic and associtaive. It is fast and solves simple problems.
We haven't been able to teach programs how to program yet. That's the next level of AI.
Lowercase, word breaks, and punctuation is awesome and helpful.
JavaScript semicolons and == are kind of the worst... and the "with" satements and multiline string literals. Avoid confusion!
He's against ++.

### Google Style Sheet
Google's style guides are impressive and comprehensive. I don't know java, but if I wanted to make sure I wrote really clean java, I would use this. They have as style guide for nearly every language, which is a great resource internally and externally.
