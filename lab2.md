2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE? (2-5 sentences)
It is important to license open source software projects to ensure that the future of your code is upheld to the standards that you want.
The license you choose will depend on if you want a permissiable license or if you are looking to have a license with mandatory copyleft.
It is important to license your code (as opposed to leaving it unlicensed) to protect yourself and your code from being used without permission.

3.Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
While programmers are not required to license their work, by omitting a license, others should not use the unlicensed code. 
One should not use code from a project without the explicit permission from the creator.
A license gives permission and directions for how others should use open source software. 
If a project has no license, you do not have permission to use, modify, or share that code.

4. Gopher
The fact that HTML is so flexile for content creators and requires little system administrators is a better way to create an online community.
Gopher would have had less complex servers, but more complex and centralized content management systems.
And, having embedded links instead of menus of files is more user friendly in HTML.

5. The MIT License is appealing for developers because it is simple, easy, and very permissive. The MIT License gives everyone explicit permission to do as they wish with the MIT licensed software. It makes distribution and modification very easy and accessible to all programmers and does not obligate you to copyleft on your projects (i.e. if you wanted to create a non-open source project using open source kernels).

7. GPL license is best for developers and for the common good because its only restriction is that the modificaions made must track with the source code and its original version, installation, and license must be included. It is easy to use and modify from a legal point of view. LGPL is best for the common good because it almost exclusively applies to libraries. "Derivatives works (including modifications or anything statically linked to the library) can only be redistributed under LGPL, but applications that use the library don't have to be." (tldrlegal). Apache/BSD is best for companies because it requires the inclusion of the company's trademark in the license.

9. The project I would like to work on in this course is creating a more interactive campus map with data about locations of classrooms and lecture halls. By either making or using a databse in PostgreSQL or SQL of all the classrooms at RPI and what floor they are on (maybe in reference from the entry floor). The users of my app will be RPI students, specifically freshmen and who need to learn where classrooms on campus are and upperclassmen at the beginning of the semester. I will use the MIT license because I want to give permission to others to collaborate with me on this project.
